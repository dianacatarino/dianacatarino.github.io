### Fundamentals of Programming
I developed a prototype application in the C language to manage registrations for activities promoted by the Student Associations of the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria. The system allows for the registration and consultation of participant data, activities, and registrations. I implemented features such as statistics, storage in binary files, and interactive menus, following good programming practices.

### Introduction to Networks and Operating Systems
I created a practical project focused on the development of a Smart Kennel using Cisco Packet Tracer software as a simulation environment. The primary goal was to apply the knowledge acquired in IoT, exploring concepts of actuation, sensing, and real-time data transmission.

### Web-Client Programming
I developed a complete website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The project focused on creating a meteorology platform, leveraging the OpenWeather API to provide real-time weather information. [Web-Client Programming Project](https://github.com/dianacatarino/projeto_pw-c)

### Application Development
I led the creation of a comprehensive management system for a cinema. The primary purpose of this software was to simplify and centralize the control of all operations inherent to the cinematographic business. [Application Development Project](https://github.com/dianacatarino/PSI_DA_PL1-E)

### Security Topics
I developed a project focused on creating a secure messaging system in C#. This project involved implementing interfaces for Windows Forms, Console Application, and Web App, dividing it into a client module and a server module.

### Design and Development of Databases
I developed a relational database in MySQL, focusing on efficiently managing a footwear warehouse, a topic approved by the course instructors. Evaluation centered on the quality of the report, database implementation, and performance in the individual oral examination.

### Mobile Access to Information Systems
I am developing a mobile application in Java to provide users with the flexibility to access the travel agency's information systems via mobile devices.

### Platforms for Information Systems
I am developing a web application in PHP as an integral part of the information systems project. This platform will provide a browser-accessible interface, allowing customers and employees to access and interact with the services offered by the travel agency efficiently and user-friendly.

### Services and Systems Interoperability
I am developing the Restful API as a key component to ensure interoperability in the travel agency project. This API will facilitate efficient communication between the mobile application, web application, and other services, ensuring the correct functioning of the system.

### Information System Project
I am developing an integrated system for a travel agency, addressing mobile application, web application, and API aspects in three distinct course units. This project provides a comprehensive solution for the travel agency's needs, incorporating modern technologies and development practices.
